/**
 * The GSoapDelegationHandler class is responsible for proxy certificate delegation on the server side
 *
 * The delegation protocol implies that in the first step the client sends a getProxy request, the server
 * generates a public and private key pair, and sends the public key to the client (it is signed using
 * server certificate). Subsequently, the client signs this request using its own private key and certificate,
 * and sends a putProxy message back to the server, containing the signed certificate.
 *
 * CGSI_GSoap provides https functionality, and is used to retrieve client DN and VOMS attributes (FQAN)
 *
 * The delegationId that identifies a proxy certificate is created based on used DN and VOMS attributes (FQANs),
 * therefore event if the delegation ID is not specified it is possible to recreate it!
