 * The InstanceHolder carries out the task of holding and grating access to an instance.

 *
 * The InstanceHolder can be used for example as the base class in order to implement
 * singleton design pattern. In this case, the deriving class should give itself as the
 * template parameter. Since the constructor of the derived class should be private, the
 * class should be a friend of InstanceHolder. For example:
 *
 * 		class C : public InstanceHolder<C> {
 *
