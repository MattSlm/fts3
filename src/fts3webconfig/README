# !!! Important requirement!!!

"Server" part (cgi-bin directory with programm to communicate with Oracle DB) of fts3webconfig consists of two files:

fts3config.ini - contains connect string and credentials for DB account in the format:
	- user <username>
	- pass <password>
	- connstring <connect string> (for DBI Oracle it looks like 'Oracle:devdb11')

There are two type of the requests: selectData and cmdModify

#       Select required data from database
#Input:
# {
#    cmd => 'selectData',
#    query => < string with select query, including ORDER BY clouse >,  #it can include placeholders ('?' sign) for binding variables
#    vals => [ array of binding values ], # in the order of placeholders (optional)
#}
#Output:
# {
#    status => < 0/1 >,    # 0=OK
#    retMsg => < error message>
#    retNative => <error from DBI>  # if exists
#    rowNum => <number of returned rows>
#    data => [
#		{ colname1 => value1, colname2 => value2, ....},
#		{ colname1 => value1, colname2 => value2, ....},
#	     ]
# }
